# 💻 SmartPricer — ML-Powered Price Prediction for Computer Gear

### Project Purpose:
To demonstrate a complete Machine Learning project — from data preprocessing and model building to full deployment as a web application.

### Business Case:
To develop a model that accurately predicts component prices and automates the traditionally manual pricing workflow.

---
### Deliverable:  
A web app that end users can use to predict component prices using a machine learning model on the backend. Live link : [SmartPricer App](https://smartpricer-ml-powered-price-prediction-for-computer-gear-yex8.streamlit.app/)

## Business Impact

SmartPricer enables **data-driven pricing decisions** for retailers, suppliers, and online marketplaces. By accurately predicting computer gear prices from product attributes it helps to:

* **Retailers** maintain competitive pricing and prevent over- or under-valuing stock.
* **Businesses** maximize profit margins while improving inventory turnover.
* **Customers** gain price transparency and fair value for money.
* **Operations teams** reduce manual price monitoring time through automated predictions.

With a reliable **92% model accuracy**, SmartPricer can save significant revenue lost to inconsistent pricing and improve **pricing efficiency by 30–40%** in dynamic markets.

---
##  Next Steps

* **Monitor model performance** periodically to detect drift or reduced accuracy.
* **Retrain the model** with new data as it becomes available to maintain prediction reliability.
* Explore **real-time data integration** from online marketplaces for dynamic price updates.
* Implement **automated retraining pipelines** for continuous improvement.
